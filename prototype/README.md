## Prototype

- `Prototypes` are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another.
- Every object in JavaScript has a built-in property, which is called its prototype
- The prototype is itself an object, so the prototype will have its own prototype, making what's called a prototype chain.
- The chain ends when we reach a prototype that has null for its own prototype.
- `__proto__` = next thing up in prototype chain

There are different ways prototype are used in javascript. 

1. [**Object Prototype**](./object-prototype/README.md).
2. [**Function Prototype**](./function-prototype/README.md).
